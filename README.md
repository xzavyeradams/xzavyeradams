## Who am I?
I'm a 16 year old student currently in my sophomore year of highschool. I am studying and planning to go to college for computer science.
I love a good challenge and expanding what I know. I've been fascinated with computers since I was little, and I started coding in the 5th grade.
I began with HTML/CSS (not a coding language, a markup language) in 5th grade, then a tiny bit of JavaScript, then a tiny bit of C++, now python.
